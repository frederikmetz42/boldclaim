## The Zero-Sum Game — Why the Right Is Winning

Five structural factors are fuelling right-wing populism. Not vibes — material conditions.

| Factor | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| Broken growth model | Since 2008, the globalised free-market system no longer delivers rising incomes or wellbeing to working people in the West |
| Zero-sum perception | When the pie stops growing, every gain for "them" feels like a loss for "us" — immigration, offshoring, diversity all get reframed as threats |
| Elite policy failure | Fiscal orthodoxy (German debt brake, French budget crisis, distributional failures of Bidenomics) prevents the state from fixing things |
| Identity over class | Identity-based social justice has displaced class-based universalism, alienating working people who see a game they can't win |
| Climate pressure | Resource scarcity, inflation, reduced output, physical vulnerability — and a fatalism among young people driving some to extremes |

**The core narrative the right sells (stripped of emotion):**

```
The system doesn't work for us. Life will only get worse.
The elites don't care.
They've rigged an identity game we can't win.
It's all the fault of immigrants / feminists / woke regulators.
The system is doomed — collapse is coming.
```

**Why the centre-left can't counter it:**
The left keeps promising a return to growth and redistribution, but people keep experiencing stagnation, competition for resources, and rising inequality. Until the left acknowledges the system is broken, it can't offer credible alternatives to the right's answers.

## Who Is Driving It — The Expanded Actor Map

Right-wing populism isn't just grassroots resentment. It's backed by a network of powerful actors:

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Radicalised tech/finance elites** | Using wealth to capture parties, media, platforms; shaping deregulation for profit (cf. Peter Thiel files) |
| **Axis of Resistance powers** | Russia, China, Iran: social media manipulation (Romania, UK riots), proxy parties (AfD, BSW), covert funding (Tenet Media), disinfo ops |
| **Western PR/data firms** | Public affairs companies and media outlets that share the far-right agenda |
| **The grifter network** | Dense global network of individuals earning money from driving discourse towards extremes — ample reward system, no equivalent for moderates |
| **Crypto movement** | Effectively a bet on breakdown of central banking and the rise of authoritarian right (cf. El Salvador) |
| **Social media platforms** | Business models that normalise extreme solutions, especially among visual/verbal consumers (cf. TikTok in Georgian election) |

**Key insight:** The thought-architecture of fascism is always more coherent than "organic" populism. No matter how mainstream the public discourse stays, the private/subcultural narrative trends toward open racism, misogyny, conspiracy, and fantasies of violence.

---

## The Expanded Grievance Matrix

Beyond the familiar older/small-town/low-education demographic shift, multiple parallel zero-sum games are emerging:

| Grievance axis | Dynamic | How the right exploits it |
|----------------|---------|--------------------------|
| **Men vs. Women** | Women's gains create misogynist backlash, especially among young men across all cultures | Incel culture, normalised sexual violence, far-right online spaces make it central |
| **Settled minorities vs. New migrants** | In insecure labour markets, established ethnic minorities turn against new arrivals | Evidenced in US 2024 (minority ethnic votes for Trump), rising in UK |
| **"Decent people" vs. Criminals** | Atomised society where low-level crime coexists with organised crime; justice system overwhelmed | UK: jails full, courts blocked, 12.5M criminal records → impression rule of law is evaporating |
| **Feminists vs. Trans rights** | Gender-critical feminists drawn into alliance with conservatives and populists | Cross-cuts all political tendencies including the labour movement |
| **Everybody vs. "Woke"** | War on woke reframed as defence of meritocracy | Mobilises anyone aggrieved by identity-based policies — not just social conservatives |

**The "Omnicause" effect:** In the online right-wing ecosystem, discontent over any single issue pulls people into alignment across all of them. Anti-vaxx → anti-woke → anti-immigration → anti-establishment → pro-authoritarian pipeline.

## What Doesn't Work — Failed Centre-Left Strategies

| Failed strategy | Example | Why it fails |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| **Ignore it and stick to old assumptions** | Macron, Trudeau | Assumes growth will fix everything; pretends fiscal/monetary orthodoxy is inviolable |
| **Embrace the culture war** | Harris/Beyonce, NZ Labour | Coalition of graduates/LGBTQ+/unions/feminists around hope messaging doesn't reach the persuadable |
| **Pander to far-right language without delivering** | Macron on migration/Islam | Legitimises their framing without satisfying their base |
| **Stigmatise as purely foreign threat** | US Russiagate narrative | Ignores deep domestic roots in civil society |

**The structural problem:** Many social democratic parties lack the capacity to process theory and professional research. Debate typically revolves around "what NOT to do" rather than building affirmative strategy.

## What Can Work — Evidence-Based Approaches

These strategies show partial success. The catch: they only work if you do ALL of them simultaneously.

### 1. Delivery in office
Higher, more inclusive growth. But where the economy rewards rent-seeking and financial profits, growth simply produces higher inequality and inflation (Biden's lesson).

### 2. Refusing the culture war
Starmer/UK Labour: instinctively defuse emotive issues (trans prisoners, Empire curriculum, Prophet controversies). Accentuate "more in common" messaging.

### 3. Controlling economic migration
Police borders against irregular migration, positively integrate arrivals, effectively police crime. Denmark model — finding growing acceptance across European centre-left.

### 4. Charismatic leadership and crisis management
Step out of faceless technocratic mode. Project a combative image that crosses political boundaries. Example: Habeck's speech against anti-Semitism.

**Why these aren't enough alone:** Conservative firewall against far-right coalitions is breaking (Sweden, Finland, EPP). Too little growth. Far right actively aided by Russian/Chinese/Iranian ops and media oligarchs. And fundamentally — the left refuses to acknowledge the zero-sum game.

---

## Elements of a Strategy

### Accept the zero-sum game and narrate a path out

```
"Yes, the system is broken."

That has to be the START of the conversation, not something
the left keeps denying while the right says it louder.

Then: here's how we fix it. Concretely. With timelines.
```

### Switch off the factors driving populism

- Restructure energy systems to decouple from global gas prices
- Use price controls, invest in skills, run industrial strategy from low- to high-value sectors
- Loosen fiscal/monetary rules strangling recovery

### Adopt universalist language

```
Primary story: redistribution of wealth to working people.
Shared hardships. Class, citizenship, universality.

NOT a story about competition between identities.
NOT abandoning anti-racism or diversity.
Just making the main narrative about what unites, not what divides.
```

**The hard truth:** Any left social democracy that is simply a collection of identitarian claims has zero chance of defeating the far right.

### Recapture patriotism

The nation state is the default democratic unit. The left cannot abandon patriotism to the far right. The task: define an inclusive, multi-ethnic, modern patriotism. Social democracy has a proud national history to claim.

### Name the guilty

```
The right has enemies. The left must too.

Direct anger at the right targets:
- Speculators and rip-off corporations
- Asset strippers and organised crime
- Far-right billionaires
- Putin, Iran, China and their proxies
```

### Demonstratively break with elite politics

Agitate among the people. Talk only about basics facing working people. Use demotic language and imagery. Stop being faceless technocratic robots.

## Militant Democracy — Hardening Democratic Defences

Democracies are not obliged to facilitate their own overthrow. Strategic defence measures:

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Map far-right targets for anti-democratic reform | Erect constitutional defences BEFORE erosion begins |
| Strengthen social media regulation | Up to temporary platform bans (cf. TikTok in Romania); aggressively police hate speech |
| Criminalise purposeful disinformation | Legal framework against deliberate lies |
| Strengthen electoral law | Prevent foreign and algorithmic manipulation |
| Monitor and expose far-right leaders | Publish private racist/misogynist utterances; expose their contempt for working people |
| Prosecute foreign interference | Force parties linked to foreign powers to register as foreign agents |
| War on organised crime | Central left theme — name and shame front organisations. End the illusion the left is soft on crime |
| Digital identity (Estonian model) | Defuse conspiracy theories about undocumented populations; assure traceability before the law |

---

## Style Shift — Combat Parties

Social democracy's political style is stuck in the pre-2008 era. Not "mirror populism" — but adapted language, narrative tools, and media ecosystem.

**Key shifts:**

```
Since we are now in a fight for democratic survival,
we have to become "combat parties" — geared to defeating
a political enemy who is ignoring the rules of the old game.
```

- Operate through networks, swarms, and clouds — not hierarchical messaging
- Trust allies (unions, youth groups, alternative media) to produce their own strategies
- Create temporary alliances with non-destructive left and left-nationalist parties
- Invest in professional research, analysis, monitoring, and political education
- Create shared understanding of objectives across factions

**The bottom line:** Defeating right-wing populism is the primary task for this generation. Everything else — Net Zero, redistribution, human rights, the rules-based order — can only be achieved by keeping the far right out of power.

## Quick Reference: The Mason Framework

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why is the right winning? | Broken growth model → zero-sum perception → identity displacing class |
| Who's behind it? | Tech oligarchs + foreign powers + grifter network + platforms |
| What doesn't work? | Ignoring it, culture war coalitions, pandering, Russiagate framing |
| What works (partially)? | Delivery + refusing culture war + migration control + charismatic leadership (ALL together) |
| What's missing? | Accepting the zero-sum game + universalist language + naming enemies + combat party style |
| What's the precondition? | Acknowledge the system is broken — out loud, to working people |
